        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Easy, 4-ingredient vegan parmesan cheese that's perfect on top of pastas, pizza, 
            and anywhere you'd usually use parmesan cheese!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>3/4 tsp sea salt</li>

            <li>Add all ingredients to a <strong>food processor</strong> and mix/pulse until a fine meal is achieved.

            <li>I love vegan parmesan on top of chilaquiles, vegan pizza, breadsticks, pastas and gratins. It's also a great addition to vegan meatballs and can be converted into mexican cheese 3 ways!</li>
